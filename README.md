Os interface is an app that takes the design of an os like Windows.
<br>
It has a system of multiple windows that can be moved, resized or minimized, ideal for having more information open at the same time.
<br>
Through the Explorer window, this app communicates via API with a server, and allows access to the file system with the source code of various projects.
